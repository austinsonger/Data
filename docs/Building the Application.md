# Building the Application


1. **Routing and Controllers**: Use Gin's routing capabilities to define endpoints for your application. You'll need routes for handling user requests, initiating data destruction, and generating certificates.
2. **Middleware Integration**: Utilize Gin's middleware for logging, error handling, and perhaps authentication.
3. **Cloud Service Integration**: Write functions or create modules for interfacing with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud APIs. This will be crucial for managing object, file, and block storage.
4. **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication for both your application users and for connecting to the cloud services. This might involve OAuth tokens for cloud services.
5. **Data Destruction Logic**: Develop the core logic for data destruction, ensuring it adheres to best practices and is compliant with legal standards.
6. **Certificate Generation**: Code the logic for generating data destruction certificates, incorporating all necessary information like cloud provider, service used, method of destruction, etc.
7. **Database Integration**: If youâ€™re storing user data, logs, or any persistent data, integrate a database of your choice with Gin.
